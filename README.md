# Live-Project
<h3> Introduction</h3>
<p> For this project I was tasked with developing a web application for a hobbiest to store a collection of things as well as relating API and data scraped. When creating this project I wanted a place for manga enthusiast to digitally store their collection, include details on those mangas, and display their covers. My Manga came forth from those ideas as well as data scraping for covers so the user would have a source to search from for their collection. The API searches based upon category giving the user the ability to find new mangas for their collection.

The initial steps of this project were giving MyManga basic CRUD operations. The user can CREATE a record of a manga adding it to a database with the user panel. Through the collection page the user can READ those details in the form of bootstrap cards. Each card has a button with EDIT and DELETE functionality. Using BeautifulSoup cover images were scraped from Anilist for users to utilize as cover sources. I connected to Kitsu's API giving the user the ability to search for mangas. A dropdown menu with category options specifies results.
